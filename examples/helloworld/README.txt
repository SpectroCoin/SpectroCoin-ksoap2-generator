Ksoap2 generating stub

1. Requirements:
- JDK 6
- The JAVA_HOME variable is set.

2. What are supported?
- The program generates code in J2ME/Android from the WSDL document.

- This version can generate web services client for web services such as:
+ Methods of web service has parameters with primitive types, but only the array
  of one dimension is supported.
+ Methods of web service has parameters with object types (these types also
  require in J2ME) such as String, Integer, Hashtable, etc. But only the array
  of one dimension of these types is supported.
+ Methods of web service has parameters with object types defined by user, these
  types are composed of the attributes that they are primitive types, object
  types (natively supported in J2ME such as Integer, Float, etc.), except the
  array of them.

3. How to generate web services client running on J2ME and Android using ksoap2?

Please execute the command as the following:
- In Linux:
   + For J2ME:
      $ java -cp ksoap2-generating-stub-0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar:$JAVA_HOME/lib/tools.jar ksoap2.generator.Wsdl2J2me -w HelloWorld.wsdl -g ./j2me
   + For Android:
      $ java -cp ksoap2-generating-stub-0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar:$JAVA_HOME/lib/tools.jar ksoap2.generator.Wsdl2Android -w HelloWorld.wsdl -g ./android

- In Windows:
   + For J2ME:
      $ java -cp ksoap2-generating-stub-0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar;"%JAVA_HOME%\lib\tools.jar" ksoap2.generator.Wsdl2J2me -w HelloWorld.wsdl -g .\j2me
   + For Android
      $ java -cp ksoap2-generating-stub-0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar;"%JAVA_HOME%\lib\tools.jar" ksoap2.generator.Wsdl2Android -w HelloWorld.wsdl -g .\android

The parameters:
 -w 	specifies the URL of the WSDL document.
 [-g]	specifies the generated folder to store generated code.

4. How to use generated code?
- Before invoking web services from J2ME or Android, you just need to configure
  the Configuration class (in the generated code) with the URL address of web
  services. Note that if you are running on the emulator (or real devices),
  the IP address of itself is always 127.0.0.1 (localhost). There are some
  examples for configuring the class as the following:

  // incorrect because of using localhost
  Configuration.setConfiguration("http://localhost:8080/Ws2Ksoap/services/HelloWorld");

  // incorrect because of using 127.0.0.1
  Configuration.setConfiguration("http://127.0.0.1:8080/Ws2Ksoap/services/HelloWorld");

  // correct because the emulator can find the web services.
  Configuration.setConfiguration("http://192.168.2.3:8080/Ws2Ksoap/services/HelloWorld");
